An insurance company has decided to change the format of its policy numbers from XXX-YY-ZZZZ to XXX/ZZZZ/YY (where X, Y and Z each represent the digits 0-9). Write a method that re-formats all policy numbers in a well-formatted paragraph ('-' may appear elsewhere in the text).

For example, changeFormat("Please quote your policy number: 112-39-8552.") should return "Please quote your policy number: 112/8552/39.".

```js
function changeFormat(paragraph) {
  // Write the code that goes here
}

console.log(changeFormat("Please quote your policy number: 112-39-8552."));
```
