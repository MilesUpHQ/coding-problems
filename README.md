## Contributors

1. Please checkout a new branch from `master` and send a pull request to add your coding problems to this repo.
2. Make sure each of problems are connected to a specific concept in the programming language you are contributing to. For eg: if I want to create a problem to test `mixin` concept, i would name the file as `mixins-problem-name.md` so that the person looking at the file name will be able to understand what the problem is about even before opening the file and looking at the problem statement. 
3. Make sure to use github markdown formating for code highlighting and other details following the standards to make sure all the files are consistent and easy for new people to understand without spending much time. 
4. All the coding problems should go within the specific directory named by the programming language. `ruby` code should be created under ruby folder. 
5. A file should only have one problem with question, possible input cases and solution formatted using github markdown standards
6. All the problems should have a simple, clearly defined question or problem statement which is self-explainatory. 
7. Solution should also be simple, easy to understand, comply with global standards and best practices.
